# israel-postal-shifting-delivery-point

As the official postal website sucks, I decided to create a simple script to get the new address of a delivery point
Just insert your home address and get suggestions for the delivery point

Everything runs locally, no data is sent to any server

The repository contains data from the official postal website, but feel free to update it
